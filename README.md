# Predicting GPA Through Regression

With this dataset, there were a few challenges, most namely dealing with the nominal variables and how to perform regression with those. I researched and came up with a technique in the pandas module: get_dummies. This added 26 new columns, but made the regression possible. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.09% on the training dataset, and an accuracy of 87.96% on the test dataset.
